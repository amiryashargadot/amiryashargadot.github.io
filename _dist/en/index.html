<p>After filing the complaint, a police investigation will be carried out, which will usually include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Filing a complaint with the police.</li>
  <li>Providing testimony - investigation of the case.</li>
  <li>Investigation of the suspect.</li>
  <li>Search for additional evidence - additional witnesses, evidence from diaries, recordings, confrontation, polygraph.</li>
  <li>Transfer of the case to the State Attorney’s Office, in accordance with the recommendations of the police.</li>
  <li>Discussion and recommendations of the State Attorney’s Office regarding the filing of an indictment.</li>
  <li>In the event that it is decided to file an indictment against the suspect, the case will be transferred to the court.</li>
</ul>

<p>Investigation proceedings and legal proceedings take a long time. Indictments are filed only in cases where the police and the State Attorney find sufficient evidence. Therefore, it is very important to be prepared for a long and complex process, to be examined in a hospital and to try to provide maximum evidence.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> Not all cases are carried out in this manner.</p>
